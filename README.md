# python-diplomaprogramme
A system that can manage Diploma Programmes and courses for a Data Science education. The system is coded in Python and in an Object-oriented design pattern. The system is intended to be easy to maintain and debug.

The system requires some specific business logic, and therefore the key requirements for
the program, is as follows:
    1. The Diploma Programme must be of high quality. Therefore, it is required for a student to pass at least three out of five mandatory assignments, to pass a course.
    2. For a student to pass a whole diploma programme, a student needs to pass all the courses.
    3. Students who are extra diligent, can receive a diploma with distinction. To receive such a diploma, a student has to pass at least 17 mandatory assignments (The total being 20). Therefore for a student to get distinction, they would have to pass all five mandatory assignments from at least one course, and four out of five for the remaining three courses.
